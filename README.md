Location-based chat app for CodePath iOS class, Spring 2014.
With Arpan Nanavati (@ananavati), Thomas Ezan (@lethargicpanda), and Eric Socolofsky (@ericsoco).

### Initial wireframes:
Screenshots and flow diagram in design/wireframe_20140405.
Alternatively, [look here](https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_s2RrycIwlFaSM9w99DwTOJl3HUBKzpAx.1396722613645) for an interactive version. (You can view it on your phone as well; I recommend adding it to Home Screen for it to fullscreen properly, to get iOS Safari chrome out of the way.)
Some notes on the wireframe:
- Login via Facebook/Twitter is optional (but encouraged); whether or not the user opts to link with either of those accounts, s/he still must choose a screen name (does not have to be unique).
- An empty chatroom displays a CTA to invite participants; the invite modal can be accessed from here or from the chat room settings view.
- A list of current chatroom participants can be opened by swiping down from the top of the chatroom view.
- We really hope to get the map view built to reinforce the metaphor of chatting in a specific location and to increase engagement on the primary/initial view (chat list), but it will come after we build out the basics of the rest of the app.
